<h2><a href="http://themouette.github.com/jquery-week-calendar/weekcalendar.html" title="Basic">Demo 1</a></h2>


	<p>Shows basic calendar functionality. Calendar Events are supplied as a local javascript array. All triggered events are displayed as messages, calendar events in the past are shaded gray using the eventRender callback.</p>


	<h2><a href="http://themouette.github.com/jquery-week-calendar/weekcalendar_demo_2.html" title="Multi data-source and dynamic config options">Demo 2</a></h2>


	<p>Allows you to select from two different data sources. These are both local javascript objects but could just as easily have come from a remote server. The data returned includes an ‘options’ property which overrides the default calendar options for ‘timeslotHeight’ and ‘timeslotsPerHour’.</p>
